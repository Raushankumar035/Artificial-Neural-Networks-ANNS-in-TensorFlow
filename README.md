# Artificial-Neural-Networks-ANNS-in-TensorFlow


Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) compose layers of nodes (neurons), where each node processes information and passes it to the next layer. TensorFlow, an open-source machine learning framework developed by Google, provides a useful environment for implementing and training ANNs.
